# grid generator

see it working [here](https://jvh-grid-generator.surge.sh)

### standard features

- makes a grid of colors
- zero css/html

### extended features

- hover & scroll to adjust number inputs
- sort colors by most used
- hover to show color hexcode
- click to copy color hexcode to clipboard

### notes

- written in typescript
- the setStyles util function is pretty cool imo.
